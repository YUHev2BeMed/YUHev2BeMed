# Description for Me.
Hello, I'm Jacob Ferrier, but I go by YUHev2BeMed... Actually, my username comes from a meme. Also, I am aware that my eaglercrafthtml 
project violated Mojang's copyright, but the original creator who is 
is going to convert it to a online minecraft client where you have to have a Microsoft account in order to play (I do not know any more about it).
